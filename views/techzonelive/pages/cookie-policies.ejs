                        you when you visit our World Wide Web at <a style="color: blue;" href="https://techzonelive.com/">https://techzonelive.com/</a>. It explains what these technologies are
                        and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
                        In some cases, we may use cookies to collect your personal information, or that becomes personal information
                        if we combine it with other information. We solely use this information just to enhance and improve user
                        browser’s experience.
                        What are Cookies?</p>
                    <p>Cookies are basically small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                        website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
                        efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Tech Dev Zone) are called “first party cookies”.
                        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies
                        enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like
                        advertising, interactive content and analytics).
                        The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website
                        in question and also when it visits certain other websites in one or different browser or computers.
                        Why do we use Cookies?</p>
                    <p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
                        order to operate our website properly, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies.
                        Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
                        Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other
                        purposes. This is described in more detail below.
                        The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they
                        perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific
                        Online Properties you visit)</p>
                    <p>How can I control Cookies?
                        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your due cookie rights by
